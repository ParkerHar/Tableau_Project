## Project/Goals

Wildlife Strikes represent a very serious risk to pilots and passengers of aircraft. Using historical data from the FAA, a dashboard was created to allow pilots to have a better understanding of the potential strike risks during their upcoming flight.

## Process
### Data Exploration
The data set was fortunately very clean and prepared which allowed me to jump right into the fun part. After reviewing the the data types present in the data set, a simple visualization was created to indetify any high risk times for wildlife strikes:

As seen above, the highest risk moments are times when the aircraft is on the run way, or during takoff/landing. This is further proven when looking at the breakdown of strikes by distance from the ground:

Further exploration was done to determine the animals that were most involved in the wildlife strike events. As initially thought, birds are far and away the most frequent animal category involved in strikes:

### Dashboard Creation
With some trends already discovered, a dashboard was created to allow pilots to look at the strike risk for their upcoming flight:
